# Android_Layout_Animations

This is another shorter project, for this one, you'll take an existing List-Detail app and add a activity transition animation with a shared element. This is best when it is an image.

> You can use any of your previous projects like the Sprint 6 Challenge, as long as there is an image, a recyclerview, and a second activity to view the details. If you need a project to start with, DM me and I'll get you one.

## Steps
1. Test the app to make sure it works properly
2. Add entrance and exit transitions to both activities (Test and Commit)
> play with all the available options until you find something that you like

3. In the list activity, when the detail activity is started, enable the transition animation (Test and Commit)
4. Set the shared element (Test and Commit)

## Test

1. Make sure the elements animate as expected

## Go Further

Add animations to the recyclerview and make other UI improvements.
